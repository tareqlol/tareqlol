Hello there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Tariq Hassan, and I am a frontend Engineer who is driven by passion and the will to learn towards Web Development. I have achieved and succeded in changing my career path from a **linguist** to a **developer**, yes that's right, I have dived into the code, into the bits and pieces of frontend development until I kickstarted the inner developer of me.
I have a good experience throughout the companies I worked in, from doing basic Responsive HTML pages, to making single page JS applications where performance is a must.
